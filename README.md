# How many epicycles would be required to draw out letters using the Fourier Transform algorithm (DFT)

Using the JS algorithm, insert the restructured file into the code. The file (usually in png) needs to be resturctured throght the python algorithm attached. The result shall be the file with the output of epicycles required to draw out any letter with DFT algorithm.
